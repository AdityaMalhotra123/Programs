# Part 1: Dynamically allocated memory in C

For this part of the assignment, you will need to complete the stub
functions in the sortInts.c and readFile.c files and modify the
provided Makefile.

# Part 2: GDBomb Repository

## Getting Started

For this part of the assignment, you will need to download a bomb
through the link on the assignment web page, extract the files from
the downloaded tar file, and add those files to a new gdbomb/
directory you create at the top level of your repository.  You will
need to put your answers to the different bomb phases into a file
named defuser.txt that you create in the gdbomb/ subdirectory.  Once
you have put all of these files into your local gdbomb/ subdirectory,
you will need to check in that subdirectory (and its related files)
into your gitlab repository (using "git add", "git commit" and "git
push").

At this point, you are ready to work on any of the CS Linux machines.
