## General Comments
This was a really nice submission! Logic was sound throughout and I was never
lost at any point in your TwoTowers class. Well done!

### Functionality
Test cases pass!

### Design
I love the design choice to make all of your helper methods static. The
solution doesn't necessarily depend on instantiating a TwoTowers object. Your
choice is very reasonable. All the helper methods you provide are very useful
and have specific purpose. Could you make a few other helpers to shorten the
length of findSubsets and main? This is a very nuanced suggestion. 

Overall very good job

### Documentation
Javadocs look great. Inline comments also provide nice extra bits of
information that I don't get from just reading your code.

## Rubric

### Assignment is anonymous

[+] Submission should be anonymous (no name at top)

### Basics

[+] Assignment compiles

### Implementation

[+] Correct solution and second-best solution for towers of size 15

[+] Correct solution and second-best solution for towers of size 18

[+] Solution is space-efficient (should not store all possible solutions to find the best and second-best)

### Design

[+] Subset iterator uses a long to track current subset; does not convert to a String to determine the subset

[+] Uses bit operations rather than Math.pow()

[+] Properly uses generics

[+] Functionality is split into helper methods


### Style

[+] Checkstyle passes
