## General Comments
Great job this week! All of the code's methods work perfectly, and the documentation is great. One general critique is that constant run time is usually indicated by O(1), not O(c).

### Functionality
As I said above, all of the methods work as intended. Good job!

### Design
The design is really good! The only issue is that some of the code's methods are missing Assert.pre() checks.

### Documentation
The code's documentation is great. To be honest, it could even be a bit less verbose in some places (you do not need to explain what every line of code does, only the general idea of non-obvious code blocks). Great job though!
