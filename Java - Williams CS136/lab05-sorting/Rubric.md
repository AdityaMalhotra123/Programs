## General Comments
Great job!
### Functionality
Functionality is perfect
### Design
Good design! Checkstyle does not pass because of a missing Javadoc. Also remember that class names are capitalized in Java by convention, so all of the comparators should start with a capital letter.
### Documentation
Good!  However, the code looks very "busy" because it does not use whitespace to aid in readability.  Please consider adding more spaces in your code.
