# Lab 0 - Setting Up Our Environments

This lab's purpose is to set up our working environments, hopefully
removing any barriers that might prevent us from working on the
material in this course. Although you will "submit" a Java program as
part of this assignment, we provide all of the required code as part
of the assignment writeup. We hope that you are able to complete the
setup before the end of your scheduled lab period, but if not, please
take advantage of the resources below.
